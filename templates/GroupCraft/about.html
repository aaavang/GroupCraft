			I wrote most of the Django templates/python backend code for this website.
			My educational focus has been in the area of Software Engineering with a focus on
			Networked Applications.  In my spare time I enjoy programming microcontrollers,
			specifically Arduinos to perform various tasks.

			I created the layouts and wrote/edited the CSS code to create the style of website.
			Other areas I helped out in were the initial requirements and the design of the system,
			for example the ER Diagram and Architecture Diagram.
			My educational background is that of database systems, and my undergrad degree is titled
			Information Systems Development. My spare time consists of chilling out, working, and playing
			guitar.
